# Drowsiness-Detection-using-Facial-Landmarks.

Deep learning today has revolutionized a gamut of industries with the Autonomous Vehicle industry being the prime one which derives most benefit from this recently famous algorithm. We see deep learning in applied in Computer Vision which forms the backbone of the modern self driving cars, in Natural language processing where it has made tremendous progress in understanding human language and deriving insights from them and in various other spectrums.

In the modern machinery of self driving and the aim of making cars more safe to be driven, almost all provisions have been made to make THE VEHICLE safe but what about the safety 
breaches resulting due to the repurcussions of careless driving? This has been a gray area in the field of Computer Vision and demands more attention for the implementation and incorporation of modern intelligent algorithms to detect careless casual driving to make the driving experience more safe. 

One of the major causes of accidents in the world is drivers being drowsy due to lack of sleep or being intoxicated. For long journeys drivers are often anxious or fearful of being drowsy in the middle of their journey and are worried as they also have to deliver their goods in time, this problem also has an impact on mental health of drivers. 

As a solution to this, I introduce a deep learning based method to detect facial landmarks of drivers while they are driving in real time and use a concept called as EYE-ASPECT-RATIO to determine whether they eyes are closed or are wide open. This simple yet powerful technique can prove quintessential to determine drowsiness in drivers and can potentially help prevent many accidents from happening.
